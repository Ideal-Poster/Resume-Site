      <p class="page-text">My career as a graphic artist started drawing as a kid.
        I always loved to draw, paint and I always kept a stetch book. As I got older I
        got more serious about approaching art a job. My interest in science also grew
        and eventually led me to computer science. I started with Ruby and expanded
        to testing and front end languages. I'm a lover of music and a 6+ year martial artist.
